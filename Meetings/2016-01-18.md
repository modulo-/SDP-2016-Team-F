We should clone a teams robot (14?) Then modify

Need to move lateral wheel to back

Group 2 has the best vision but needs speed improvements
group 14 has the best defence
Group 7/12 has a good wiki of vision

The Rf link is unreliable so we need a comm protocol, packets get lost:
ack, etcetera
we also need to have the robot behave reasonably when contact is lost, not blindly continue
