Main talking points:

* Solonoid kicker
  - First team with the idea
  - Resets by closing the grabbers with ball
* Sideways movement
  - Forward/backward not necessary for defence
  - Makes intercepting and blocking both faster and easier
* Grabbers
  - Fast
  - Open by default, which is easier than many other teams designs and allows
    immediate grabbing
  - Hide away
* General policy
  - Do one thing and ~~do it well~~ not fuck it up.
  - Our robot is simple in design, but works.
