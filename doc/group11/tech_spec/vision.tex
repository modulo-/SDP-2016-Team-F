\section{Vision}

The vision system was designed to be simple and fast, both to aid in development and to minimise the delay of a movement on the
pitch being registered by the system. Originally a system was being developed from the ground up, but after a number of failures
and difficulties the decision was made to use Group 12's working system. Group 12's system was adapted from a previous year's
system and is the system used for the rest of the project.
