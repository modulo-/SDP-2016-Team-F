\section{Introduction}

The aim of this project was to create a robot that would play a simplified
version of 2-a-side football. We used the provided Arduino Xino RF board and
LEGO pieces, a vision feed of the pitch, and computers to connect the two and
implement any further logic. This report will examine the decisions made in the
design of each part and their impacts. Furthermore it will explain the
principles our work relies on.

\section{Hardware Notes}

Grabbing the ball effectively is a fine balance of speed. Moving the grabbers
too quickly kicks the ball away. On the other hand, moving too slowly may lead
to missing the ball. Further, the design of the robot means that the ball must
be pushed in sharply to reset the kicker. The balance between these that was
found, is to close the grabbers at a moderate speed, then rapidly open them
part way and rapidly close them again. This resets the kicker, does not kick the ball away in most cases, and is fast enough to be usable.

Kicking the ball is a matter of speed, the faster we can kick, the less time
our opponents have to react. However, in order to kick, the ball must also be
positioned precicely in front of the kicker. To achieve this, the grabbers
rapidly push the ball into position again, correcting any drift from movement.
They open part-way, just enough for the kicker to kick without the ball
hitting the grabbers. Finally, the grabbers finish opening.

Spinning and moving tends to move the grabbers about. To avoid this, the
grabbers are powered slightly during both of these actions. If the grabbers are
open, they are constantly opening while the robot is moving, albeit very
slowly. Likewise, the grabbers keep closing if they are already closed. For
this purpose, the robot maintains a local state variable for the grabber. It is
worth stating that this is not measured or sensed, so manually moving the
grabbers will confuse the robot.
