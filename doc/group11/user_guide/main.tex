\section{Troubleshooting}

Below are the actions to take for various common problems which may occur to
attempt to fix them.

\subsection{The Robot Doesn't Move}

If the robot is not moving, the first thing to do is to check the batteries.
Ensure that they are present, and charged. Next, disconnect the battery packs,
wait for a few seconds, then reconnect them.

\subsection{The Control Program Doesn't Start}

The control program not starting is likely due to the RF control signals
blocking. To test this, run the control program without the argument for the RF
stick. If it runs, then try waiting for five seconds, then re-running with the
normal arguments. If after a few attempts, this also does not work, then double
check the guard characters set on the RF stick. They should be three tilde
characters (`\verb$~~~$'). Use the proprietary CISCO tools located in the
`tools' folder to do this. If needed, reset the guard characters or change them
in the source.

\subsection{The Vision is Misdetecting Objects}

The vision misdetecting objects is likely due to miscalibration. Close the
controller, restart and recalibrate. Take care to select a wide range of colour
samples, including the fringes of the circles to detect.

\subsection{The Robot is Very Slow}

The batteries are low. Recharge or replace them.

\subsection{The Kicker Doesn't Work}

Check the connections between the two 4-packs of batteries, as well as the I/O
port kicker connection. Ensure that the kicker is pressed in, but has not
fallen out in the back. Check the battery level of the two 4-packs.
