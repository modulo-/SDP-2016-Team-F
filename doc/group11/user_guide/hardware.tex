\section{Robot Structure}

Our robot has four sideways-facing holonomic wheels, one at each corner, which
can move the robot sideways and spin it on the spot. It can not move forwards,
aside from turning, then moving sideways. At the base of the robot, on the
front side, a solenoid kicker is mounted. This is extended to kick the ball,
and reset when the ball is grabbed. For this purpose, two grabber arms, which
rest on the left and right sides of the robot, swing around the front-left and
front-right corners to close around the kicker, pushing the ball into it. At
the rear of the robot, a battery pack for four lithium-ion batteries is
mounted. This is secured by diagonal LEGO bars, which must be removed to access
the battery pack.
