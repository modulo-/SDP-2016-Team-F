%User Guide No more than 6 pages, worth 10 (out of 50) marks

%Reports have three purposes: to provide sufficient information to assess your work; to document for the group and yourself your design and what you have done; and to provide useful information for anyone who wants to build on what you have done in future. Reports may contain detailed appendices beyond the page limit, particularly in aid of the last two goals; but markers are not required to read these appendices. A common mistake is to overuse the appendicesâ€” figures, tables, or other material that explains your work belongs in the main report, not an appendix. Large illustrations will not count towards the page limits.
