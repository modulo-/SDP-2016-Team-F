We built a robot and taught it to dance.

Group final report No more than 12 pages, worth 16 (out of 50) marks

Reports have three purposes: to provide sufficient information to assess your work; to
document for the group and yourself your design and what you have done; and to provide
useful information for anyone who wants to build on what you have done in future.
Reports may contain detailed appendices beyond the page limit, particularly in aid of the
last two goals; but markers are not required to read these appendices. A common mistake
is to overuse the appendicesâ€” figures, tables, or other material that explains your work
belongs in the main report, not an appendix. Large illustrations will not count towards
the page limits.
