1. Introduction:

Some grammar needs polishing, for example:

"Once ready to use, place a charged batteries in the back holder, "


The following paragraph is tricky to read: 
"
Plug the RF stick in the computer, ensure top plates of all types, as well as the ball, are on
the pitch, and execute ‘./main -p <PLAN> -1 <PATH> -c <COLOR>’, there <PLAN> is the plan
to run (see section below), <PATH> is the device path of the RF stick (e.g. ‘/dev/ttyACM0’),
and <COLOR> is the team color, which must be one of ‘blue’, ‘b’, ‘yellow’, or ‘y’ respectively.
Further options notably include the ‘-l’ option, which sets the logging level. E.g. ‘-l info’
enables info messages in the logger.
"

Due to its algorithmic nature I sugggest you either bullet point it or detail it as an algorithm.



1.1 Plans

A tiny bit more detail could help with this section.


2. Vision

2.1 Requirements. 
This seems fine.


2.2 Usage

Some of these paragraphs could be made more clear and cut down by bullet pointing commands.

A picture would be helpful here. Labeled screenshot of the vision running. Planning vision linkage should be specified with an FSM like diagram just a paragraph is hard to parse.


3 Planning

bullet pointing would help here again and if its not an overkill a labelled picture would help too.



4 Hardware


For this section pictures would definitely assit with the changing battery procedure.




5 Arduino Software


"determined by the radius of the wheels * pi * rotation."

Use math mode for this and helpful notation.  For some parts in section 5 (turn for example) you are taking a bit of a tangenton almost the physics of what the turn implies. If I am a user I am mostly interested in output input information . I click "this" then the robot does "this". Examples would help in some parts fof this section.
