## Configuring the SRF stick and the RF chip
Simplest way is to use the graphical XCM (XRF Config Manager). This can be found in the tools directory.
Guard character are likely to be # or ~. Sadly this only works on Windows.

Once the equipment is configured there is no need to use any code to reconfigure it (though it might be good to do nonetheless).
The configuration is persistent.

## Arduino Libraries
To use the arduino code you need to have the libraries used correctly linked. 
Library files can be found in the repo, but linking is broken.
