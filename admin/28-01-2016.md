# Hardware
Joel and Margus will work on rebuilding the robot. Meeting at 10am on Sat to start work.

The principle of commands will likely remain the same, but the API for control will likely change.
Code on arduino needs to be swapped out.


# Planning
Hugh and Chloe to meet Marek on Fri at 4pm.

Devise a design for the planning software. Create a prototype.
If one planner is going to control both robots ensure that the software design supports this without ugly hacks.

Planner will assume the capabilities currently present in the robot control API for now. 
Control API can be changed to accommodate the planner better (e.g. specifying move speeds)

Planner needs to be aware of robot capabilities: strafing, turning radii and speeds (?) etc.
atm group 11 robot cannot move forwards and group 12 robot arduino code does not support strafing.


# Vision
Simeon and Sanchit will be in charge of vision.
Margus and Sanchit will try to get some old vision system(s) running on Thu evening 5-7. Simeon might come later in the evening.
