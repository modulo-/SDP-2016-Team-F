# Milestone 1

Wednesday, 3:30pm

Group 11 - room 3.D04

Group 12 - room 3.D03

## Move
Work in progress
Joel will stay on it, if needed others will step in.

## Kick
Recalibrate before milestone, but done

## Comms
Done

# Vision
Base it on group 12. HSV instead of RGB. HSV helps in calibrating and normalising. 

For i in xrange is way better than for element in list. np.asarray is faster than np.array. 

Dots and rectangles to detect. Dot, ball and plate needed for Milestone 2.

Output the world state as a dict

# Planner
Take world representation and work with that

Draw a diagram
